      <p>
        The project involved creating a bespoke game in the form of a quiz, with
        the purpose of researching learning techniques amongst students. I
        worked closely with the client to achieve the specific requirements they
        requested.
      </p>
      <strong className="list-title">The concept was simple:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>There were 5 rounds</li>
        <li>
          At the beginning of each round, the player starts off with 5 points
        </li>
        <li>
          They then watch a video, and then answer several questions to test
          their knowledge on the subject
        </li>
        <li>
          If they answer all questions correctly, they proceed to the next
          round. Get one incorrect? They lose a point and must watch the whole
          video again
        </li>
        <li>
          When they complete the final round, the user is shown their score
        </li>
        <li>
          Statistics about a playerâ€™s performance, and behaviour were
          automatically saved to a Google Drive spreadsheet which colid be
          accessed by the client.
        </li>
      </ul>
