      <h3>What was it?</h3>
      <p>
        This project was developed as an investigation into how technology could
        be used to aid political movements such as Black Lives Matter, with
        userâ€™s privacy and anonymity placed at the forefront of the design.
      </p>
      <h3>How did it work?</h3>
      <p>
        The website provided the basic tools to create and manage events, while
        allowing communication between the host and attendees.
      </p>
      <h3>How was it made?</h3>
      <p>
        Firebase was used to store user and event data. I built the API to
        handle communications with the client using Firebase and Node.js with
        Express.
      </p>
      <p>
        The front-end was created with React and Next.js, alongside Redux. I
        then used Tailwind to implement the design
      </p>
